# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 🎨

This is an interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **Python**,matplotlib and **Streamlit**. It allows you to visualize how different sorting algorithms work in real-time with colorful animated bar charts.

## 🧠 What Are Sorting Algorithms?

Sorting algorithms help organize data in a specific order (ascending or descending). Understanding how they work is key to learning data structures and algorithms efficiently.

This app helps you see how each algorithm behaves and how many comparisons/swaps it makes.
